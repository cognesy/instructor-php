## Event classes

Instructor dispatches multiple classes of events during its execution. All of them are descendants of `Event` class.

You can listen to these events and react to them in your application, for example to log information or to monitor the execution process.

Check the list of available event classes in the `Cognesy\Instructor\Events` namespace.

## Event methods

Each Instructor event offers following methods, which make interacting with them more convenient:

 * `print()` - prints a string representation of the event to console output
 * `printDebug()` - prints a string representation of the event to console output, with additional debug information
 * `asConsole()` - returns the event in a format suitable for console output
 * `asLog()` - returns the event in a format suitable for logging


## Receiving notification on internal events

Instructor allows you to receive detailed information at every stage of request and response processing via events.

 * `(new StructuredOutput)->onEvent(string $class, callable $callback)` method - receive callback when specified type of event is dispatched
 * `(new StructuredOutput)->wiretap(callable $callback)` method - receive any event dispatched by Instructor, may be useful for debugging or performance analysis

Receiving events can help you to monitor the execution process and makes it easier for a developer to understand and resolve any processing issues.

```php
$structuredOutput = (new StructuredOutput)
    // see requests to LLM
    ->onEvent(HttpRequestSent::class, fn($e) => dump($e))
    // see responses from LLM
    ->onEvent(HttpResponseReceived::class, fn($event) => dump($event))
    // see all events in console-friendly format
    ->wiretap(fn($event) => $event->print())
    // log all events in log-friendly format
    ->wiretap(fn($event) => YourLogger::log($event->asLog()))

$structuredOutput->with(
    messages: "What is the population of Paris?",
    responseModel: Scalar::integer(),
)->get();
// check your console for the details on the Instructor execution
// @doctest id="bba4"
```


## Convenience methods for get streamed model updates

`StructuredOutput` class provides convenience methods allowing client code to receive
model updates  when streaming is enabled:

 * `onPartialUpdate(callable $callback)` - to handle partial model updates of the response
 * `onSequenceUpdate(callable $callback)` - to handle partial sequence updates of the response

In both cases your callback will receive updated model, so you don't have to
extract it from the event.
