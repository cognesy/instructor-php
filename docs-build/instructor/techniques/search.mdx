## Expanding Search Queries

In this example, we will demonstrate how to leverage the enums and typed arrays to segment a complex search prompt into multiple, better structured queries that can be executed separately against specialized APIs or search engines.

### Motivation

Extracting a list of tasks from text is a common use case for leveraging language models. This pattern can be applied to various applications, such as virtual assistants like Siri or Alexa, where understanding user intent and breaking down requests into actionable tasks is crucial. In this example, we will demonstrate how to use Instructor to segment search queries, so you can execute them separately against specialized APIs or search engines.


## Structure of the Data

The `SearchQuery` class is a PHP class that defines the structure of an individual search query. It has three fields: `title`, `query`, and `type`. The `title` field is the title of the request, the `query` field is the query to search for relevant content, and the `type` field is the type of search. The `execute` method is used to execute the search query.

```php
<?php
enum SearchType : string {
    case TEXT = "text";
    case IMAGE = "image";
    case VIDEO = "video";
}

class Search
{
    /** @var SearchQuery[] */
    public array $queries = [];
}

class SearchQuery
{
    public string $title;
    /**  Rewrite query for a search engine */
    public string $query;
    /** Type of search - image, video or text */
    public SearchType $type;

    public function execute() {
        // ... write actual search code here
        print("Searching for `{$this->title}` with query `{$this->query}` using `{$this->type->value}`\n");
    }
}
// @doctest id="b4ea"
```


## Segmenting the Search Prompt

The `segment` function takes a string `data` and segments it into multiple search queries. It uses the `StructuredOutput::create()` method to send a prompt and extract the data into the target object. The `responseModel` parameter specifies `Search::class` as the model to use for extraction.

```php
<?php
use Cognesy\Instructor\StructuredOutput;

function segment(string $data) : Search {
    return (new StructuredOutput())->with(
        messages: [[
            "role" => "user",
            "content" => "Consider the data below: '\n$data' and segment it into multiple search queries",
        ]],
        responseModel: Search::class,
    )->get();
}

foreach (segment("Search for a picture of a cat and a video of a dog")->queries as $query) {
    $query->execute();
    // dump($query);
}
// @doctest id="f959"
```
