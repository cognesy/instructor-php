## Environment Configuration

Instructor uses environment variables for configuration settings and API keys. The library comes with
a `.env-dist` template file that lists all supported variables.

You can copy it to `.env` (or merge with your `.env` file) and fill in your values.

Alternatively, you can set the variables directly in your environment

Check [setup instructions](/setup) for more details on how to set up your environment and how it can
be done automatically with the Instructor's CLI tool.

<Warning>
    Keep your .env file secure and never commit it to version control.
    For production, consider using your environment's secrets management system.
</Warning>


### LLM Provider API Keys

Instructor supports multiple LLM providers.

Configure the ones you plan to use:

```ini
# OpenAI (default provider)
OPENAI_API_KEY=''

# Alternative providers
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=''
ANYSCALE_API_KEY=''
AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=''
AZURE_OPENAI_EMBED_API_KEY=''
COHERE_API_KEY=''
FIREWORKS_API_KEY=''
GEMINI_API_KEY=''
GROK_API_KEY=''
GROQ_API_KEY=''
MISTRAL_API_KEY=''
OLLAMA_API_KEY=''
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=''
TOGETHER_API_KEY=''
JINA_API_KEY=''
```

Only configure the services you plan to use; others can remain empty.

### Other API Keys in `.env-dist`

Instructor comes with bundled add-on capabilities that use other APIs for various purposes.
You can find them in the `.env-dist` file. They are not required for the core functionality of Instructor.


### Instructor Configuration Directory Path

Instructor uses a configuration directory to store its settings, e.g. LLM provider configurations.

You can set the path to this directory in your `.env` file:
```
INSTRUCTOR_CONFIG_PATH='/../../config/'
```

This tells Instructor where to find its configuration files, if it has not been configured manually
via `Settings` class. The path is relative to the vendor directory where Instructor is installed.

<Note>
    `INSTRUCTOR_CONFIG_PATH` is set automatically if you use the Instructor CLI tool to publish assets.
