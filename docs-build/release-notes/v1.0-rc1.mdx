 - (all) Multiple breaking changes - proceed with caution
 - (instructor) the `Instructor` class is being replaced with `StructuredOutput` class; the old class will be kept for some time to allow for a smooth transition.
 - (all) Common conventions for working with StructuredOutput, Inference, and Embeddings classes
 - (examples) All examples have been updated to use the new `StructuredOutput` class and recommended create(), generate() methods
 - (docs) Updated documentation to reflect the new `StructuredOutput` class and its usage
 - (instructor) Extracted structured output config into a separate file config/structured.php (and removed from config/llm.php)
 - (instructor) Added structured output config object
 - (instructor) Cleaned up ChatTemplate class
 - (instructor) Response and response streams are now cached after the first call, so multiple calls to `StructuredOutputResponse::response()` or `StructuredOutputResponse::stream()` do not cause re-processing (deserialization, validation, transformation) of the response value
 - (instructor) StructuredOutput class offers fluent API for creating structured output requests
 - (instructor) StructuredOutputResponse now offers getXxx() methods for getting the response value as a specific type (e.g. getString(), getInt(), getFloat(), getBool(), getArray(), getObject())
 - (instructor) Removed `input` argument from StructuredOutput methods and StructuredOutputRequest class - use `messages` instead - (examples) Added StructuredOutput fluent API example
 - (polyglot) Added fluent API calls to Inference class
 - (polyglot) Added fluent API calls to Embeddings class
 - (polyglot) Corrections in inference drivers, fixed defects in JSON/JSON Schema modes
 - (polyglot) Fixed error in selection of embeddings driver
 - (polyglot) Added `withDebug()` support to Embeddings class
 - (polyglot) Added experimental support for HuggingFace inference API
 - (all) Multiple changes, improvements and refactorings in the codebase
 - (all) Updated docs and examples to reflect the latest changes
