## Changes

### Bug Fixes

- Prevent null dereference when finalizing streaming responses with no current attempt
  - packages/polyglot/src/Inference/Data/InferenceExecution.php
    - Null-safe access to `currentAttempt` in `withFinalizedPartialResponse()` and `withFailedFinalizedResponse()`
  - packages/polyglot/src/Inference/Data/InferenceAttempt.php
    - Null-safe `withFinalizedPartialResponse()` using empty `PartialInferenceResponseList` when needed

- Console display stability in evals
  - packages/evals/src/Console/Display.php
    - Replaced invalid `ImmutableDataMap::except()` usage with safe filtering of `toArray()` output
    - Fixed constant name `COLOR::BOLD` → `Color::BOLD`

### Behavior/Compatibility

- Groq driver request body cleanup
  - packages/polyglot/src/Inference/Drivers/Groq/GroqBodyFormat.php
    - Removed redundant `max_tokens` → `max_completion_tokens` conversion (already handled by parent)

### Immutability & Usage Accounting

- Immutable accumulation for usage data to avoid inadvertent mutation/double-counting
  - packages/polyglot/src/Inference/InferenceResponseFactory.php
    - Use `withAccumulated(...)` when combining partial usage
  - packages/addons/src/StepByStep/State/Traits/HandlesUsage.php
    - Replace clone+mutate with `withAccumulated(...)`
  - packages/evals/src/Traits/Experiment/HandlesAccess.php
    - Compute experiment usage on demand by accumulating execution usages immutably
  - packages/evals/src/Experiment.php
    - Removed cached `$usage` and post-run accumulator; observations/summary rely on computed usage

### Notes

- This release focuses on correctness and immutability:
  - Eliminates potential fatals in streaming finalization and console display
  - Standardizes usage accumulation to immutable patterns across modules
