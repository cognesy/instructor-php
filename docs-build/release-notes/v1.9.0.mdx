## 1.9.0 Summary

- Unified execution model across Instructor and Polyglot
- Streaming and usage accounting made consistent and test‑covered
- Cleaner APIs and collections, clearer events

### Instructor
- Execution/Attempts: `StructuredOutputExecution` + `StructuredOutputAttempt` track full lifecycle (final + partials, errors).
- Streaming: sequence updates yield immutable snapshots; final event payload standardized to `value` (+ `cached`).
- Usage: execution = finalized attempts + current partial tokens (until finalization). Attempt list usage counts only finalized.
- API cleanup: removed unused `$messages` from `withCurrentAttempt/withFailedAttempt/withSuccessfulAttempt` (retries come from execution history).
- Collections: `StructuredOutputAttemptList::of` variadic fix; `fromArray` supports wrapped and flat input.

### Polyglot
- Execution/Attempts: `InferenceExecution` + `InferenceAttempt` with immutable transitions and full state.
- Usage: attempt usage = finalized response + partial tokens; AttemptList = only finalized; Execution = finalized + current partials.
- Collections: variadic fixes (`InferenceAttemptList`, `InferenceResponseList`); `fromArray` uses `ArrayList::fromArray`.
- Correctness: `InferenceAttempt::hasErrors/isFailed` safety.

### Embeddings
- Facade: declared resolver property; removed unused field; avoid duplicate “requested” event (driver emits once).
- Shortcuts: `first()` returns `?Vector`. Cosine similarity guarded for zero vectors.

### Breaking Changes
- Instructor `StructuredOutputExecution`: removed `$messages` params from attempt helpers.
- Instructor `RequestHandler`: `responseFor` → `executionResultFor`; `streamResponseFor` → `streamUpdatesFor`.
- Usage semantics tightened to avoid double counting (see above).
- Polyglot driver/collection variadic behavior corrected.
