## Overview

Sometimes we just want to get quick results without defining a class for
the response model, especially if we're trying to get a straight, simple
answer in a form of string, integer, boolean or float. Instructor provides
a simplified API for such cases.

## Example

```php
<?php
require 'examples/boot.php';

use Cognesy\Instructor\Extras\Scalar\Scalar;
use Cognesy\Instructor\StructuredOutput;

enum CitizenshipGroup : string {
    case US = "US";
    case Canada = "Canada";
    case Germany = "Germany";
    case Other = "Other";
}

$text = "His name is Jason, he is 28 years old American who lives in Germany.";
$value = (new StructuredOutput)->with(
    messages: $text,
    prompt: 'What is user\'s citizenship?',
    responseModel: Scalar::enum(CitizenshipGroup::class, name: 'citizenshipGroup'),
)->get();


dump($value);

assert($value instanceof CitizenshipGroup);
expect($value == CitizenshipGroup::Other);
?>
```
