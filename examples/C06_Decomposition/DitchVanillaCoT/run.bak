## Ditch Vanilla Chain Of Thought

Plan and Solve1 improves the use of an improved Zero-Shot Chain Of Thought (CoT) prompt which adds more detailed instructions to the prompt given to these large language models.

Plan and Solve Prompt

[User Prompt]

Let’s first understand the problem, extract relevant variables and their corresponding numerals, and make a complete plan.Then, let’s carry out the plan, calculate intermediate variables (pay attention to correct numerical calculation and commonsense), solve the problem step by step, and show the answer.

[Model Response]

Therefore the answer(arabic numerals) is

This is a two step process which guides the LLM to pay more attention to calculation and intermediate results to ensure that they are correctly performed as much as possible.

Generate Reasoning: In the first step we prompt the model with the user's query and prime the model using plan and solve prompting to explicitly devise a plan for solving a problem before generating an intermediate reasoning process
Extract Answer : Once we've obtained the model's reasoning, we then extract the answer from a new prompt which includes the model's chain of thought.


We can implement this using instructor as seen below.

```python

client = instructor.from_openai(OpenAI())
