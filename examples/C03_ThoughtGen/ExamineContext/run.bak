## Examine The Context

By encouraging our model to examine each source in the provided context, we can help mitigate the impact of irrelevant context. This improves reasoning performance and the final output. This is known as Thread Of Thought.

We can implement Thread Of Thought using the following template.

### Thread Of Thought template

[ Input Prompt ]
Proceed through the context systematically, zeroing in on areas that could provide the answers weâ€™re seeking

### Example

We can implement this using Instructor as seen below.

```python
import instructor
from openai import OpenAI
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from textwrap import dedent

client = instructor.from_openai(OpenAI())


class ThreadOfThoughtResponse(BaseModel):
    analysis: list[str] = Field(
        description="""An explanation for each relevant source explaining
        its relevance and content""",
    )
    correct_answer: int


def analyze_context_and_generate_response(query: str, context: list[str]):
    return client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-4o",
        response_model=ThreadOfThoughtResponse,
        messages=[
            {
                "role": "system",
                "content": dedent(
                    f"""

                """
                ),
            },
            {
                "role": "user",
                "content": query,
            },
            {
                "role": "assistant",
                "content": dedent(
                    """
                    Navigate through the context incrementally,
                    identifying and summarizing relevant portions.
                    """
                ),
            },
        ],
    )


if __name__ == "__main__":
    context = [
        "The price of a house was $100,000 in 2024",
        """The Great Wall of China is not visible from space
        with the naked eye""",
        """Honey never spoils; archaeologists have found pots
        of honey in ancient Egyptian tombs that are over
        3,000 years old""",

        years old and is located in California""",
        "The price of a house was $80,000 in 2023",
    ]
    query = "What was the increase in the price of a house from 2023 to 2024"
    response = analyze_context_and_generate_response(query, context)
    print(response.model_dump_json(indent=2))
    """
    {
      "analysis": [
        "The price of a house was $80,000 in 2023",
        "The price of a house was $100,000 in 2024"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 20000
    }
