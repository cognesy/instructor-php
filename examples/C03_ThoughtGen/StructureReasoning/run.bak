Structure The Reasoning

By getting language models to output their reasoning as a structured markdown table, we can improve their reasoning capabilities and the quality of their outputs. This is known as Tabular Chain Of Thought (Tab-CoT).

We can implement this using instructor as a response object as seen below to ensure we get exactly the data that we want. Each row in our table is represented here as a ReasoningStep object.

```python
import instructor
from openai import OpenAI
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from textwrap import dedent

client = instructor.from_openai(OpenAI())


class ReasoningStep(BaseModel):
    step: int = Field(description="The step number")
    subquestion: str = Field(description="Subquestion to solve")
    procedure: str = Field(
        description="""Any intermediate computation
        that was done in the reasoning process. Leave
        empty if no computation is needed""",
    )
    result: str


class Response(BaseModel):
    reasoning: list[ReasoningStep] = Field(
        description="reasoning steps to derive answer",
    )
    correct_answer: int


def generate_structured_reasoning_response(query: str, context: str):
    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-4o",
        response_model=Response,
        messages=[
            {

                ),
            },
        ],
    )
    return response


if __name__ == "__main__":
    query = "How many loaves of bread did they have left?"
    context = """

      ],
      "correct_answer": 74

```

This generates the following reasoning step and the correct response of 74.
