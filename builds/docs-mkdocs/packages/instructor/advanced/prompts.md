Prompt templating is not the core responsibility of this package.

Within `cognesy/instructor-struct`, the main prompt hooks are:

- `withSystem(...)`
- `withPrompt(...)`
- `withExamples(...)`
- `withCachedContext(...)`

If your application needs a larger prompt-management system, use a companion package or your framework's existing template layer and pass the rendered strings into `StructuredOutput`.
