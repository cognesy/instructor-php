title: Adapters
description: How drivers translate between Polyglot data and provider payloads.

Most inference drivers are built from a few adapter responsibilities:

- message mapping
- request body mapping
- HTTP request translation
- response translation
- usage translation

That is why many drivers have classes such as:

- `*MessageFormat`
- `*BodyFormat`
- `*RequestAdapter`
- `*ResponseAdapter`
- `*UsageFormat`

The public contract they serve is still simple:

- `InferenceRequest` in
- `InferenceResponse` or `PartialInferenceDelta` out
