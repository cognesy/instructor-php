description: 'Where environment variables matter.'

Environment variables matter at provider configuration time, not in the structured-output API itself.

In practice:

- your app or preset loader reads environment variables
- `LLMConfig` resolves provider settings
- `StructuredOutputRuntime` uses the resulting config

That keeps the package independent from any one framework bootstrap process.
