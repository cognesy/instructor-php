title: Response Models
description: 'How schemas are derived from the target type.'
---

Response models are turned into a schema before the request is sent.

The common sources are:

- PHP classes
- object instances
- JSON schema arrays
- helper wrappers such as `Scalar`, `Sequence`, and `Maybe`

That schema is used both to guide the model and to deserialize the result on the way back.
