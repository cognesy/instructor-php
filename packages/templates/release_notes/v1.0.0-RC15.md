 - (utils) Default config path is now taken from `INSTRUCTOR_CONFIG_PATHS` environment variable. `INSTRUCTOR_CONFIG_PATH` is still recognized for backward compatibility, but it is recommended to use `INSTRUCTOR_CONFIG_PATHS` instead. Default config location is now your project root's `config` directory, with fallback to the bundled config directory if not set.
