# Symfony Overview

`packages/symfony` is the first-party Symfony integration package for InstructorPHP.

The package is still landing in phases, but the baseline framework surface is already live:

- one bundle to register
- one coherent `instructor` config root
- core runtime bindings for Inference, Embeddings, StructuredOutput, HTTP, and events
- initial AgentCtrl builders and context-aware runtime adapters
- native-agent session store selection with an explicit persistence seam
- package-owned telemetry exporter, projector, and lifecycle wiring

The package consolidates Symfony-facing glue that would otherwise be scattered across application code or lower-level packages.
The intent is one supported installation path for Symfony apps instead of ad hoc event, HTTP, and container wiring.

The public framework config root remains `instructor`, with explicit subtrees for:

- core runtime configuration
- AgentCtrl
- native agents
- sessions
- telemetry
- logging
- testing
- delivery

Framework ownership is split intentionally:

- `packages/symfony` owns Symfony-specific registration, config, and service wiring
- `packages/events` keeps reusable event-dispatch primitives
- `packages/logging` keeps reusable logging primitives while `packages/symfony` owns the long-term Symfony logging entrypoint and migration path

See `packages/symfony/docs/logging.md` for the explicit ownership and deprecation strategy for the older `packages/logging` Symfony bundle path.
See `packages/symfony/docs/telemetry.md` for exporter selection, projector ownership, and lifecycle hooks.
See `packages/symfony/docs/delivery.md` for the runtime-to-Symfony event-bridging and delivery model.
See `packages/symfony/docs/testing.md` for the package test harness, override seams, and the current public-helper boundary.
See `packages/symfony/docs/operations.md` for the practical web, API, Messenger, and CLI observability patterns.
See `packages/symfony/docs/migration.md` for the move from scattered Symfony glue onto the package-owned bundle surface.
See `packages/symfony/docs/runtime-surfaces.md` for the practical split between core primitives, `AgentCtrl`, and native agents.

Use the quickstart for installation and first-working examples, then the configuration guide for the full supported config surface.
