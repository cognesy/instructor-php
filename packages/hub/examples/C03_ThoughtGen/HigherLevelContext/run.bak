## Consider Higher-Level Context

How can we encourage an LLM to think through any high-level context required to answer a query? Step-back prompting encourages this in two steps:

- Abstraction: Ask the LLM a generic, higher-level concept. This is generally topic-specific. This is known as the step-back question.
- Reasoning: Ask the LLM the original question, given its answer to the abstract question. This is known as abstracted-grounded reasoning.

### Step-Back Prompting Example

- Original Question: What happens to the pressure of an ideal gas when temperature and volume are increased?
- Step-Back Question: What are the physics concepts associated with this question?
- Reasoning Prompt: {step-back response} {original question}

Note that the step-back question is also generated using an LLM query.

Step-back prompting has been shown to improve scores on reasoning benchmarks for PaLM-2L and GPT-4.*

```python
import openai
import instructor
from pydantic import BaseModel
from typing import Iterable, Literal

client = instructor.from_openai(openai.OpenAI())


class Stepback(BaseModel):
    original_question: str
    abstract_question: str


class Education(BaseModel):
    degree: Literal["Bachelors", "Masters", "PhD"]
    school: str
    topic: str
    year: int


class Response(BaseModel):
    school: str


def generate_stepback_question():
    return client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-4o",
        response_model=Stepback,
        messages=[
            {
                "role": "user",
                "content": f"""
                You are an expert at world knowledge. Your task is to step back
                and paraphrase a question to a more generic step-back question,
                which is easier to answer.

                Here are a few examples:
                Original Question: Which position did Knox Cunningham hold from
                May 1955 to Apr 1956?
                Step-back Question: Which positions has Knox Cunningham held in
                his career?
                Original Question: Who was the spouse of Anna Karina from 1968
                to 1974?
                Step-back Question: Who were the spouses of Anna Karina?
                Original Question: Which team did Thierry Audel play for from
                2007 to 2008?
                Step-back Question: Which teams did Thierry Audel play for in
                his career?

                Now, generate the step-back question for the following question:
                Estella Leopold went to which school between Aug 1954 and
                Nov 1954?
                """,
            },
        ],
    )


def ask_stepback_question(stepback):
    return client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-4o",
        response_model=Iterable[Education],
        messages=[
            {"role": "user", "content": stepback.abstract_question},
        ],
    )


def get_final_response(stepback, stepback_response):
    return client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-4o",
        response_model=Response,
        messages=[
            {
                "role": "user",

                Q: {stepback.abstract_question},
                A: {stepback_response}
                Q: {stepback.original_question}
                A:
                """,
            },
        ],
    )
