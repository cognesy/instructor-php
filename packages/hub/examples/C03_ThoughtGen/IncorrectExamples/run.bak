## Include Incorrect Examples

We can get better performance from our model when using chain-of-thought by including examples of incorrect reasoning. This helps our language model to learn what mistakes to avoid when generating a response. This is known as Contrastive Chain Of Thought1 and can be done using the following template.

> **Contrastive Chain Of Thought template**
>
> sample question sample question
> correct reasoning incorrect reasoning example
> sample question sample question

We can implement Contrastive Chain Of Thought using instructor as seen below.

```python
import instructor
from openai import OpenAI
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from textwrap import dedent

client = instructor.from_openai(OpenAI())


class ChainOfThought(BaseModel):
    chain_of_thought: str = Field(description="Incorrect reasoning for the answer")
    correct_answer: str

    query: str,
    context: str,
    example_prompt: str,
    correct_examples: list[str],
    incorrect_examples: list[str],
):
    correct_example_prompt = "\n".join(
        [f"<Explanation>{example}</Explanation>" for example in correct_examples]
    )
    incorrect_example_prompt = "\n".join(
        [
            f"<WrongExplanation>{example}</WrongExplanation>"
