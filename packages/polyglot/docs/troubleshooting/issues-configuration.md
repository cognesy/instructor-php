title: Configuration Issues
description: Preset loading problems are usually path or field mistakes.

Check these points:

- the preset file name matches the name passed to `using(...)`
- the file lives in `config/llm/presets` or `config/embed/presets`
- required fields such as `driver`, `apiUrl`, `endpoint`, and `model` are present
- integer fields such as `maxTokens`, `dimensions`, and `maxInputs` are valid integers

If config is dynamic, prefer building `LLMConfig` or `EmbeddingsConfig` directly.
