title: Authentication Issues
description: Check preset credentials first.

If authentication fails:

1. confirm the environment variable used in the preset is set
2. confirm the preset points at the right provider endpoint
3. confirm the selected preset matches the provider you expect

For example, `Inference::using('openai')` expects the `openai` preset and its configured `apiKey`.
