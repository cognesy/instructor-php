## Command history

Claude Code maintains command history for the current session:

* History is stored per working directory
* Cleared with `/clear` command
* Use Up/Down arrows to navigate (see keyboard shortcuts above)
* **Note**: History expansion (`!`) is disabled by default

### Reverse search with Ctrl+R

Press `Ctrl+R` to interactively search through your command history:

1. **Start search**: Press `Ctrl+R` to activate reverse history search
2. **Type query**: Enter text to search for in previous commands - the search term will be highlighted in matching results
3. **Navigate matches**: Press `Ctrl+R` again to cycle through older matches
4. **Accept match**:
   * Press `Tab` or `Esc` to accept the current match and continue editing
   * Press `Enter` to accept and execute the command immediately
5. **Cancel search**:
   * Press `Ctrl+C` to cancel and restore your original input
   * Press `Backspace` on empty search to cancel

The search displays matching commands with the search term highlighted, making it easy to find and reuse previous inputs.

## Background bash commands

Claude Code supports running bash commands in the background, allowing you to continue working while long-running processes execute.

### How backgrounding works

When Claude Code runs a command in the background, it runs the command asynchronously and immediately returns a background task ID. Claude Code can respond to new prompts while the command continues executing in the background.

To run commands in the background, you can either:

* Prompt Claude Code to run a command in the background
* Press Ctrl+B to move a regular Bash tool invocation to the background. (Tmux users must press Ctrl+B twice due to tmux's prefix key.)

**Key features:**

* Output is buffered and Claude can retrieve it using the BashOutput tool
* Background tasks have unique IDs for tracking and output retrieval
* Background tasks are automatically cleaned up when Claude Code exits

**Common backgrounded commands:**

* Build tools (webpack, vite, make)
* Package managers (npm, yarn, pnpm)
* Test runners (jest, pytest)
* Development servers
* Long-running processes (docker, terraform)

### Bash mode with `!` prefix

Run bash commands directly without going through Claude by prefixing your input with `!`:

```bash  theme={null}
! npm test
! git status
! ls -la
```

Bash mode:

* Adds the command and its output to the conversation context
* Shows real-time progress and output
* Supports the same `Ctrl+B` backgrounding for long-running commands
* Does not require Claude to interpret or approve the command

This is useful for quick shell operations while maintaining conversation context.
