<Note>
  **New VS Code Extension (Beta)**: Prefer a graphical interface? Our new [VS Code extension](/en/vs-code) provides an easy-to-use native IDE experience without requiring terminal familiarity. Simply install from the marketplace and start coding with Claude directly in your sidebar.
</Note>

## What Claude Code does for you

* **Build features from descriptions**: Tell Claude what you want to build in plain English. It will make a plan, write the code, and ensure it works.
* **Debug and fix issues**: Describe a bug or paste an error message. Claude Code will analyze your codebase, identify the problem, and implement a fix.
* **Navigate any codebase**: Ask anything about your team's codebase, and get a thoughtful answer back. Claude Code maintains awareness of your entire project structure, can find up-to-date information from the web, and with [MCP](/en/mcp) can pull from external datasources like Google Drive, Figma, and Slack.
* **Automate tedious tasks**: Fix fiddly lint issues, resolve merge conflicts, and write release notes. Do all this in a single command from your developer machines, or automatically in CI.

## Why developers love Claude Code

* **Works in your terminal**: Not another chat window. Not another IDE. Claude Code meets you where you already work, with the tools you already love.
* **Takes action**: Claude Code can directly edit files, run commands, and create commits. Need more? [MCP](/en/mcp) lets Claude read your design docs in Google Drive, update your tickets in Jira, or use *your* custom developer tooling.
* **Unix philosophy**: Claude Code is composable and scriptable. `tail -f app.log | claude -p "Slack me if you see any anomalies appear in this log stream"` *works*. Your CI can run `claude -p "If there are new text strings, translate them into French and raise a PR for @lang-fr-team to review"`.
* **Enterprise-ready**: Use the Claude API, or host on AWS or GCP. Enterprise-grade [security](/en/security), [privacy](/en/data-usage), and [compliance](https://trust.anthropic.com/) is built-in.
