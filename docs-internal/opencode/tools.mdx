description: Manage the tools an LLM can use.
---

Tools allow the LLM to perform actions in your codebase. OpenCode comes with a set of built-in tools, but you can extend it with [custom tools](/docs/custom-tools) or [MCP servers](/docs/mcp-servers).

By default, all tools are **enabled** and don't need permission to run. But you can configure this and control the [permissions](/docs/permissions) through your config.

---

## Configure

You can configure tools globally or per agent. Agent-specific configs override global settings.

By default, all tools are set to `true`. To disable a tool, set it to `false`.

---

### Global

Disable or enable tools globally using the `tools` option.

```json title="opencode.json"
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "tools": {
    "write": false,
    "bash": false,
    "webfetch": true
  }
}
```

You can also use wildcards to control multiple tools at once. For example, to disable all tools from an MCP server:

```json title="opencode.json"
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "tools": {
    "mymcp_*": false
  }
}
```

---

### Per agent

Override global tool settings for specific agents using the `tools` config in the agent definition.

```json title="opencode.json" {3-6,9-12}
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "tools": {
    "write": true,
    "bash": true
  },
  "agent": {
    "plan": {
      "tools": {
        "write": false,
        "bash": false
      }
    }
  }
}
```

For example, here the `plan` agent overrides the global config to disable `write` and `bash` tools.

You can also configure tools for agents in Markdown.

```markdown title="~/.config/opencode/agent/readonly.md"
---
description: Read-only analysis agent
mode: subagent
tools:
  write: false
  edit: false
  bash: false
---

Analyze code without making any modifications.
```

[Learn more](/docs/agents#tools) about configuring tools per agent.

---

## Built-in

Here are all the built-in tools available in OpenCode.

---

### bash

Execute shell commands in your project environment.

```json title="opencode.json" {4}
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "tools": {
    "bash": true
  }
}
```

This tool allows the LLM to run terminal commands like `npm install`, `git status`, or any other shell command.

---

### edit

Modify existing files using exact string replacements.

```json title="opencode.json" {4}
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "tools": {
    "edit": true
  }
}
```

This tool performs precise edits to files by replacing exact text matches. It's the primary way the LLM modifies code.

---

### write

Create new files or overwrite existing ones.

```json title="opencode.json" {4}
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "tools": {
    "write": true
  }
}
```

Use this to allow the LLM to create new files. It will overwrite existing files if they already exist.

---

### read

Read file contents from your codebase.

```json title="opencode.json" {4}
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "tools": {
    "read": true
  }
}
```

This tool reads files and returns their contents. It supports reading specific line ranges for large files.

---

### grep

Search file contents using regular expressions.

```json title="opencode.json" {4}
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "tools": {
    "grep": true
  }
}
```

Fast content search across your codebase. Supports full regex syntax and file pattern filtering.

---

### glob

Find files by pattern matching.

```json title="opencode.json" {4}
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "tools": {
    "glob": true
  }
}
```

Search for files using glob patterns like `**/*.js` or `src/**/*.ts`. Returns matching file paths sorted by modification time.

---

### list

List files and directories in a given path.

```json title="opencode.json" {4}
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "tools": {
    "list": true
  }
}
```

This tool lists directory contents. It accepts glob patterns to filter results.

---

### lsp (experimental)

Interact with your configured LSP servers to get code intelligence features like definitions, references, hover info, and call hierarchy.

:::note
This tool is only available when `OPENCODE_EXPERIMENTAL_LSP_TOOL=true` (or `OPENCODE_EXPERIMENTAL=true`).
:::

```json title="opencode.json" {4}
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "tools": {
    "lsp": true
  }
}
```

Supported operations include `goToDefinition`, `findReferences`, `hover`, `documentSymbol`, `workspaceSymbol`, `goToImplementation`, `prepareCallHierarchy`, `incomingCalls`, and `outgoingCalls`.

To configure which LSP servers are available for your project, see [LSP Servers](/docs/lsp).

---

### patch

Apply patches to files.

```json title="opencode.json" {4}
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "tools": {
    "patch": true
  }
}
```

This tool applies patch files to your codebase. Useful for applying diffs and patches from various sources.

---

### skill

Load a [skill](/docs/skills) (a `SKILL.md` file) and return its content in the conversation.

```json title="opencode.json" {4}
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "tools": {
    "skill": true
  }
}
```

You can control approval prompts for loading skills via [permissions](/docs/permissions) using `permission.skill`.

---

### todowrite

Manage todo lists during coding sessions.

```json title="opencode.json" {4}
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "tools": {
    "todowrite": true
  }
}
```

Creates and updates task lists to track progress during complex operations. The LLM uses this to organize multi-step tasks.

:::note
This tool is disabled for subagents by default, but you can enable it manually. [Learn more](/docs/agents/#tools)
:::

---

### todoread

Read existing todo lists.

```json title="opencode.json" {4}
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "tools": {
    "todoread": true
  }
}
```

Reads the current todo list state. Used by the LLM to track what tasks are pending or completed.

:::note
This tool is disabled for subagents by default, but you can enable it manually. [Learn more](/docs/agents/#tools)
:::

---

### webfetch

Fetch web content.

```json title="opencode.json" {4}
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "tools": {
    "webfetch": true
  }
}
```

Allows the LLM to fetch and read web pages. Useful for looking up documentation or researching online resources.

---

## Custom tools

Custom tools let you define your own functions that the LLM can call. These are defined in your config file and can execute arbitrary code.

[Learn more](/docs/custom-tools) about creating custom tools.

---

## MCP servers

MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers allow you to integrate external tools and services. This includes database access, API integrations, and third-party services.

[Learn more](/docs/mcp-servers) about configuring MCP servers.

---

## Internals

Internally, tools like `grep`, `glob`, and `list` use [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) under the hood. By default, ripgrep respects `.gitignore` patterns, which means files and directories listed in your `.gitignore` will be excluded from searches and listings.

---

### Ignore patterns

To include files that would normally be ignored, create a `.ignore` file in your project root. This file can explicitly allow certain paths.

```text title=".ignore"
!node_modules/
!dist/
!build/
```

For example, this `.ignore` file allows ripgrep to search within `node_modules/`, `dist/`, and `build/` directories even if they're listed in `.gitignore`.
