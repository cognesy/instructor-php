title: Providers
description: Using any LLM provider in OpenCode.
---

import config from "../../../config.mjs"
export const console = config.console

OpenCode uses the [AI SDK](https://ai-sdk.dev/) and [Models.dev](https://models.dev) to support for **75+ LLM providers** and it supports running local models.

To add a provider you need to:

1. Add the API keys for the provider using the `/connect` command.
2. Configure the provider in your OpenCode config.

---

### Credentials

When you add a provider's API keys with the `/connect` command, they are stored
in `~/.local/share/opencode/auth.json`.

---

### Config

You can customize the providers through the `provider` section in your OpenCode
config.

---

#### Base URL

You can customize the base URL for any provider by setting the `baseURL` option. This is useful when using proxy services or custom endpoints.

```json title="opencode.json" {6}
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "provider": {
    "anthropic": {
      "options": {
        "baseURL": "https://api.anthropic.com/v1"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## OpenCode Zen

OpenCode Zen is a list of models provided by the OpenCode team that have been
tested and verified to work well with OpenCode. [Learn more](/docs/zen).

:::tip
If you are new, we recommend starting with OpenCode Zen.
:::

1. Run the `/connect` command in the TUI, select opencode, and head to [opencode.ai/auth](https://opencode.ai/auth).

   ```txt
   /connect
   ```

2. Sign in, add your billing details, and copy your API key.

3. Paste your API key.

   ```txt
   ┌ API key
   │
   │
   └ enter
   ```

4. Run `/models` in the TUI to see the list of models we recommend.

   ```txt
   /models
   ```

It works like any other provider in OpenCode. And is completely optional to use
it.

---

## Directory

Let's look at some of the providers in detail. If you'd like to add a provider to the
list, feel free to open a PR.

### Amazon Bedrock

To use Amazon Bedrock with OpenCode:

1. Head over to the **Model catalog** in the Amazon Bedrock console and request
   access to the models you want.

   :::tip
   You need to have access to the model you want in Amazon Bedrock.
   :::

1. You'll need either to set one of the following environment variables:
   - `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`: You can get this by creating an IAM user and generating
     an access key for it.
   - `AWS_PROFILE`: First login through AWS IAM Identity Center (or AWS SSO) using
     `aws sso login`. Then get the name of the profile you want to use.
   - `AWS_BEARER_TOKEN_BEDROCK`: You can generate a long-term API key from the
     Amazon Bedrock console.

   Once you have one of the above, set it while running opencode.

   ```bash
   AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=XXX opencode
   ```

   Or add it to your bash profile.

   ```bash title="~/.bash_profile"
   export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=XXX
   ```

1. Run the `/models` command to select the model you want.

   ```txt
   /models
   ```

---

### Anthropic

We recommend signing up for [Claude Pro](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-pro) or [Max](https://www.anthropic.com/max).

1. Once you've signed up, run the `/connect` command and select Anthropic.

   ```txt
   /connect
   ```

2. Here you can select the **Claude Pro/Max** option and it'll open your browser
   and ask you to authenticate.

   ```txt
   ┌ Select auth method
   │
   │ Claude Pro/Max
   │ Create an API Key
   │ Manually enter API Key
   └
   ```

3. Now all the the Anthropic models should be available when you use the `/models` command.

   ```txt
   /models
   ```

##### Using API keys

You can also select **Create an API Key** if you don't have a Pro/Max subscription. It'll also open your browser and ask you to login to Anthropic and give you a code you can paste in your terminal.

Or if you already have an API key, you can select **Manually enter API Key** and paste it in your terminal.

For more providers and advanced features like caching and rate limiting, check the [Helicone documentation](https://docs.helicone.ai).

#### Optional Configs

In the event you see a feature or model from Helicone that isn't configured automatically through opencode, you can always configure it yourself.

Here's [Helicone's Model Directory](https://helicone.ai/models), you'll need this to grab the IDs of the models you want to add.

```jsonc title="~/.config/opencode/opencode.jsonc"
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "provider": {
    "helicone": {
      "npm": "@ai-sdk/openai-compatible",
      "name": "Helicone",
      "options": {
        "baseURL": "https://ai-gateway.helicone.ai",
      },
      "models": {
        "gpt-4o": {
          // Model ID (from Helicone's model directory page)
          "name": "GPT-4o", // Your own custom name for the model
        },
        "claude-sonnet-4-20250514": {
          "name": "Claude Sonnet 4",
        },
      },
    },
  },
}
```

#### Custom Headers

Helicone supports custom headers for features like caching, user tracking, and session management. Add them to your provider config using `options.headers`:

```jsonc title="~/.config/opencode/opencode.jsonc"
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "provider": {
    "helicone": {
      "npm": "@ai-sdk/openai-compatible",
      "name": "Helicone",
      "options": {
        "baseURL": "https://ai-gateway.helicone.ai",
        "headers": {
          "Helicone-Cache-Enabled": "true",
          "Helicone-User-Id": "opencode",
        },
      },
    },
  },
}
```

##### Session tracking

Helicone's [Sessions](https://docs.helicone.ai/features/sessions) feature lets you group related LLM requests together. Use the [opencode-helicone-session](https://github.com/H2Shami/opencode-helicone-session) plugin to automatically log each OpenCode conversation as a session in Helicone.

```bash
npm install -g opencode-helicone-session
```

Add it to your config.

```json title="opencode.json"
{
  "plugin": ["opencode-helicone-session"]
}
```

The plugin injects `Helicone-Session-Id` and `Helicone-Session-Name` headers into your requests. In Helicone's Sessions page, you'll see each OpenCode conversation listed as a separate session.

##### Common Helicone headers

| Header                     | Description                                                   |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Helicone-Cache-Enabled`   | Enable response caching (`true`/`false`)                      |
| `Helicone-User-Id`         | Track metrics by user                                         |
| `Helicone-Property-[Name]` | Add custom properties (e.g., `Helicone-Property-Environment`) |
| `Helicone-Prompt-Id`       | Associate requests with prompt versions                       |

See the [Helicone Header Directory](https://docs.helicone.ai/helicone-headers/header-directory) for all available headers.

## Custom provider

To add any **OpenAI-compatible** provider that's not listed in the `/connect` command:

:::tip
You can use any OpenAI-compatible provider with opencode. Most modern AI providers offer OpenAI-compatible APIs.
:::

1. Run the `/connect` command and scroll down to **Other**.

   ```bash
   $ /connect

   ┌  Add credential
   │
   ◆  Select provider
   │  ...
   │  ● Other
   └
   ```

2. Enter a unique ID for the provider.

   ```bash
   $ /connect

   ┌  Add credential
   │
   ◇  Enter provider id
   │  myprovider
   └
   ```

   :::note
   Choose a memorable ID, you'll use this in your config file.
   :::

3. Enter your API key for the provider.

   ```bash
   $ /connect

   ┌  Add credential
   │
   ▲  This only stores a credential for myprovider - you will need to configure it in opencode.json, check the docs for examples.
   │
   ◇  Enter your API key
   │  sk-...
   └
   ```

4. Create or update your `opencode.json` file in your project directory:

   ```json title="opencode.json" ""myprovider"" {5-15}
   {
     "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
     "provider": {
       "myprovider": {
         "npm": "@ai-sdk/openai-compatible",
         "name": "My AI ProviderDisplay Name",
         "options": {
           "baseURL": "https://api.myprovider.com/v1"
         },
         "models": {
           "my-model-name": {
             "name": "My Model Display Name"
           }
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

   Here are the configuration options:
   - **npm**: AI SDK package to use, `@ai-sdk/openai-compatible` for OpenAI-compatible providers
   - **name**: Display name in UI.
   - **models**: Available models.
   - **options.baseURL**: API endpoint URL.
   - **options.apiKey**: Optionally set the API key, if not using auth.
   - **options.headers**: Optionally set custom headers.

   More on the advanced options in the example below.

5. Run the `/models` command and your custom provider and models will appear in the selection list.

---

##### Example

Here's an example setting the `apiKey`, `headers`, and model `limit` options.

```json title="opencode.json" {9,11,17-20}
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "provider": {
    "myprovider": {
      "npm": "@ai-sdk/openai-compatible",
      "name": "My AI ProviderDisplay Name",
      "options": {
        "baseURL": "https://api.myprovider.com/v1",
        "apiKey": "{env:ANTHROPIC_API_KEY}",
        "headers": {
          "Authorization": "Bearer custom-token"
        }
      },
      "models": {
        "my-model-name": {
          "name": "My Model Display Name",
          "limit": {
            "context": 200000,
            "output": 65536
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Configuration details:

- **apiKey**: Set using `env` variable syntax, [learn more](/docs/config#env-vars).
- **headers**: Custom headers sent with each request.
- **limit.context**: Maximum input tokens the model accepts.
- **limit.output**: Maximum tokens the model can generate.

The `limit` fields allow OpenCode to understand how much context you have left. Standard providers pull these from models.dev automatically.

---

## Troubleshooting

If you are having trouble with configuring a provider, check the following:

1. **Check the auth setup**: Run `opencode auth list` to see if the credentials
   for the provider are added to your config.

   This doesn't apply to providers like Amazon Bedrock, that rely on environment variables for their auth.

2. For custom providers, check the opencode config and:
   - Make sure the provider ID used in the `/connect` command matches the ID in your opencode config.
   - The right npm package is used for the provider. For example, use `@ai-sdk/cerebras` for Cerebras. And for all other OpenAI-compatible providers, use `@ai-sdk/openai-compatible`.
   - Check correct API endpoint is used in the `options.baseURL` field.
