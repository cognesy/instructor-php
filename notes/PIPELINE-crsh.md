# Pipeline Design Evolution: Technical Exploration

## Executive Summary

This document explores the evolution of our pipeline processing system toward a more sophisticated computational model that aligns with modern approaches in LLM-powered application development. Our design trajectory parallels established patterns in PyTorch computation graphs, DSPy module composition, and EffectTS/ZIO effect systems.

## Current State Analysis

### Core Abstractions
1. **ProcessingStep**: Unified transformation unit (`process(ProcessingState): ProcessingState`)
2. **Middleware**: Interception pattern (`handle(ProcessingState, callable): ProcessingState`)
3. **Pipeline**: Sequential composition engine implementing `CanProcessState`
4. **Workflow**: Conditional composition with branching logic

### Key Characteristics
- Linear and conditional execution patterns
- Explicit state management through `ProcessingState`
- Composable building blocks with shared `CanProcessState` interface

## Future Trajectories for LLM Applications

### InstructorPHP Alignment
**Structured Output Processing:**
```
Input → [Extraction Step] → [Validation Step] → [Transformation Step] → Structured Output
```
- Type-safe processing steps aligned with data schemas
- Automatic retry mechanisms for validation failures
- Streaming partial results for long-running operations

### DSPy-Inspired Composition

```
- Declarative specification of language programs
- Built-in prompt compilation and optimization
- Assertion-driven program refinement

### Hamilton-Style Semantic Graphs
**Semantic Processing DAG:**
```
Raw Input → [Entity Extraction] ──→ [Relationship Mapping] ──→ [Knowledge Graph]
                          ↓                              ↓
                   [Sentiment Analysis] ─→ [Context Enrichment] ─→ [Summary Generation]
```
- Parallel execution of independent semantic operations
- Shared context propagation across processing branches
- Incremental graph refinement and expansion

## Proposed Solution Architecture

### Core Abstractions

```php
class ComputationGraph {
    public function addNode(string $id, ProcessingStep $step): self;
    public function addEdge(string $from, string $to): self;
    public function execute(ProcessingState $initialState): ProcessingState;
    public function optimize(): self;  // Graph optimization
}
```

#### 3. State Management

    public function withContext(array $context): self;
    public function withTags(TagInterface ...$tags): self;
    public function isSuccess(): bool;
    public function isError(): bool;
}
```

- Synchronous execution model
- Simple debugging and tracing

#### 2. Parallel Execution

## Integration with LLM Ecosystem

### Instructor Integration
```php
$pipeline = Pipeline::empty()
    ->extract(Person::class)      // Structured extraction
    ->validate()                  // Automatic validation
    ->transform(fn($person) =>    // Custom transformation
        new PersonSummary($person->name, $person->age))
    ->execute($llmResponse);
```

### Prompt Optimization
```php
$program = LanguageProgram::define()
    ->template('system', $systemPrompt)
    ->template('user', $userPrompt)
    ->assert(fn($output) => strlen($output) > 100)  // Length assertion
    ->assert(fn($output) => sentiment($output) > 0.5) // Sentiment assertion
    ->optimize($optimizer)  // Automatic optimization
    ->compile();
```

### Semantic Graph Processing
```php
$semanticGraph = SemanticGraph::build()
    ->extractEntities()
    ->mapRelationships()
    ->enrichContext()
    ->generateInsights()
