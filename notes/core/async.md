# Async / parallel processing

Identify capabilities of the engine that could be parallelized, so we can speed up processing
of the results, esp. for large data sets.

Async is even more important for agent-type apps, where we want to build complex, multistep
processing flows. Being able to process them in parallel would speed up the processing.
