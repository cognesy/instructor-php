## Design Principles Summary

When creating solution designs, always consider:

- **Domain First**: Start with the business domain, not the technology
- **Type Safety**: Leverage PHP's type system to prevent runtime errors
- **Immutability**: Prefer immutable data structures and functional patterns
- **Explicit Errors**: Use Result types instead of exceptions for flow control
- **Clean Architecture**: Keep dependencies pointing inward
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Design for the current need but allow for future growth
- **Team Capability**: Match design complexity to team experience level
- **Pragmatic Trade-offs**: Balance perfection with delivery timelines

The goal is to create designs that are robust, maintainable, and implementable by the team while solving real business problems effectively.
