title: Embeddings
description: 'Embeddings are a way to represent data (text, images, audio) in a continuous vector space.'
---

Embeddings are a key component of many LLM-based solutions and are used to represent text
(or multimodal data) with numbers capturing their meaning and relationships.

## `Embeddings` class

`Embeddings` class offers access to embeddings APIs and convenient methods to find top K vectors
or documents most similar to provided query.

## Supported providers

`Embeddings` class supports following embeddings providers:
- Azure
- Cohere
- Gemini
- Jina
- Mistral
- OpenAI

Embeddings providers access details can be found and modified via
`/config/embed.php`.

## Usage example

In this example, we use OpenAI embeddings provider to generate embeddings for a given list of documents
(only one in this case).

The result is a list of embeddings vectors (one per document).

```php
<?php
use Cognesy\Polyglot\Embeddings\Embeddings;

$docs = ['Computer vision models are used to analyze images and videos.'];

$embedding = (new Embeddings)
    ->withConnection('openai')
    ->create(input: $docs)
    ->all();
?>
```
