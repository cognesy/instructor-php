## What is Instructor?

Instructor is a library that allows you to get structured, validated data from multiple types of inputs: text,
chat messages, or images. It is powered by Large Language Models (LLMs).

The library is inspired by the [Instructor](https://jxnl.github.io/instructor/) for Python created by [Jason Liu](https://twitter.com/jxnlco).

## Feature Highlights

Instructor is designed to make it easy to process data with LLMs in PHP. Here are some of the key features of the library:

### Core features

- Get structured responses from LLM inference
- Validation of returned data
- Automated retries in case of errors when LLM responds with invalid data

### Flexible inputs

- Process various types of input data: text, series of chat messages or images
- 'Structured-to-structured' processing - provide object or array as an input and get object with the results of inference back
- Demonstrate examples to improve the quality of inference

### Customizable outputs

- Define response data model the way to need: type-hinted classes, JSON Schema arrays, or dynamically define your data shapes with Structures
- Customize prompts and retry prompts
- Use attributes or PHP DocBlocks to provide additional instructions for LLM
- Customize response model processing by providing your own implementation of schema, deserialization, validation and transformation interfaces

### Sync and streaming support

- Receive synchronous or streaming responses
- Get partial updates & stream completed sequence items

### Observability

- Get detailed insight into internal processing via events

### Support for multiple LLMs / API providers

- Use multiple LLM API providers (incl. OpenAI,  Anthropic, Cohere, Azure, Groq, Mistral, Fireworks AI, Ollama, OpenRouter, Together AI)
- Use local models with Ollama

### Documentation and examples

- Learn more from growing documentation and 50+ cookbooks
