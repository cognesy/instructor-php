## Configuration Groups

Instructor's configuration is organized into groups. Each group contains a set of settings that are related to a specific aspect of Instructor's functionality.

Instructor comes with the following default settings groups:
- `debug`: Debugging settings
- `embed`: Embedding provider connections
- `http`: HTTP client configurations
- `llm`: LLM provider connections
- `prompt`: Prompt libraries and their settings
- `web`: Web service providers (e.g. scraper API configurations)

Each group is stored in a separate file in the configuration directory. The file name corresponds to the group name.
