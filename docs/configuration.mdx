### Setting Configuration Path via `Settings` Class

You can set Instructor configuration path using the `Settings::setPath()` method:

```php
<?php
use Cognesy\Instructor\Utils\Settings;

Settings::setPath('/path/to/config');
?>
```

### Setting Configuration Path via Environment Variable

You can set the path to Instructor's configuration directory in your `.env` file:

```ini
INSTRUCTOR_CONFIG_PATH='/path/to/config/'
```



## Configuration Location Resolution

Instructor uses a configuration directory with a set of `.php` files to store its settings, e.g. LLM provider configurations.

Instructor will look for its configuration location in the following order:
- If static variable value `$path` in `Settings` class is set, it will use it,
- If `INSTRUCTOR_CONFIG_PATH` environment variable is set, it will use its value,
- Finally, it will default to the directory, which is bundled with Instructor package (under `/config`) and contains default set of configuration files.




## Configuration Groups

Instructor's configuration is organized into groups. Each group contains a set of settings that are related to a specific aspect of Instructor's functionality.

> NOTE: Individual configuration files are documented in their related sections.

Instructor comes with the following default settings groups:
- `debug`: Debugging settings
- `embed`: Embedding provider connections
- `http`: HTTP client configurations
- `llm`: LLM provider connections
- `prompt`: Prompt libraries and their settings
- `web`: Web service providers (e.g. scraper API configurations)

Each group is stored in a separate file in the configuration directory. The file name corresponds to the group name.



## `Settings` Class

`Settings` class is the main entry point for telling Instructor where to look for its configuration. It allows you to set up path of Instructor's configuration directory and access Instructor settings.

`Settings` class provides the following methods:
- `setPath(string $path)`: Set the path to Instructor's configuration directory
- `getPath(): string`: Get current path to Instructor's configuration directory
- `has($group, $key): bool`: Check if a specific setting exists in Instructor's configuration
- `get($group, $key, $default): mixed`: Get a specific setting from Instructor's configuration
- `set($group, $key, $value)`: Set a specific setting in Instructor's configuration

You won't usually need to use these methods directly, but they are used internally by Instructor to access configuration settings.
