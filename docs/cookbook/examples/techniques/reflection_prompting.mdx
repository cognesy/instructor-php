## Overview

This implementation of Reflection Prompting with Instructor provides a structured way
to encourage LLM to engage in more thorough and self-critical thinking processes,
potentially leading to higher quality and more reliable outputs.


## Example

```php
<?php
$loader = require 'vendor/autoload.php';
$loader->add('Cognesy\\Instructor\\', __DIR__.'../../src/');

use Cognesy\Instructor\Enums\Mode;
use Cognesy\Instructor\Instructor;
use Cognesy\Instructor\Schema\Attributes\Instructions;

class ReflectiveResponse {
    #[Instructions('Is problem solvable and what domain expertise it requires')]
    public string $assessment;

    #[Instructions('Describe a persona who would be able to solve this problem, their skills and experience')]
    public string $persona;

    #[Instructions('Initial analysis and approach to the problem of the expert persona')]
    public string $initialThinking;

    /** @var string[] */
    #[Instructions('Steps of reasoning leading to the final answer - how would the expert persona think through the problem')]
    public array $chainOfThought;

    #[Instructions('Critical examination of the reasoning process - what could go wrong, what are the assumptions')]
    public string $reflection;

    #[Instructions('Final answer after reflection')]
    public string $finalOutput;

    // Validation method to ensure thorough reflection
    public function validate(): array {
        $errors = [];
        if (empty($this->reflection)) {
            $errors[] = "Reflection is required for a thorough response.";
        }
        if (count($this->chainOfThought) < 2) {
            $errors[] = "Please provide at least two steps in the chain of thought.";
        }
        return $errors;
    }
}

$text = 'If a+|a|=0, try to prove that a<0';

$solution = (new Instructor)->withClient('anthropic')->respond(
    prompt: $text,
    responseModel: ReflectiveResponse::class,
    options: ['max_tokens' => 2048]
);

print("Problem:\n$text\n\n");
dump($solution);

?>
```
