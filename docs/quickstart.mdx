## Install Instructor with Composer

Installing Instructor is simple. Run following command in your terminal, and you're on your way to a smoother data handling experience!

```bash
composer require cognesy/instructor-php
```


## Publish Instructor Files to Your Project

Instructor comes with a set of configuration files and prompt templates that you can publish to your project directory. This will allow you to customize the library's behavior and use different prompt templates.

```bash
./vendor/bin/instructor publish
```

This will publish following files to your chosen locations:
- `.env`: Template for environment variables that contain API keys for external services, e.g. LLM providers
- `config/`: Directory with Instructor configuration files
- `prompts/`: Directory containing prompt templates



## Set Up LLM Provider API Key(s)

Open the `.env` file in your project directory and set up API keys for the LLM providers you plan to use. You can find the keys in the respective provider's dashboard.

```ini
# OpenAI (default provider)
OPENAI_API_KEY='your-openai-api-key'
```


## Set Configuration Location

Instructor uses a configuration directory to store its settings, e.g. LLM provider configurations. You can set the path to this directory in your `.env` file:

```ini
INSTRUCTOR_CONFIG_PATH='/path/to/your/config/dir/'
```


## Create a New PHP File

In your project directory, create a new PHP file and require Composer's autoloader:

```php instructor-test.php
<?php
// get the Composer autoloader
$loader = require 'vendor/autoload.php';
// add the Instructor namespace
$loader->add('Cognesy\\Instructor\\', __DIR__ . '../../src/');

use Cognesy\Instructor\Instructor;

// Step 1: Define target data structure(s)
class City {
    public string $name;
    public string $country;
    public int $population;
}

// Step 2: Use Instructor to run LLM inference
$city = (new Instructor)->withConnection('openai')->respond(
    messages: 'What is the capital of France?',
    responseModel: City::class,
);

// Step 3: Work with structured response data
assert($city instanceof City); // true
assert($city->name === 'Paris'); // true
assert($city->country === 'France'); // true
assert(is_int($city->population)); // true

echo $city->name; // Paris
echo $city->country; // France
echo $city->population; // 2140526

var_dump($city);
// City {
//     name: "Paris"
//     country: "France"
//     population: 2140526
// }
```

Now, you can run you example:

```bash
php instructor-test.php
```
