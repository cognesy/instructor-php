## HTTP Connectivity via SaloonPHP

Instructor uses [SaloonPHP](https://saloon.dev) as its HTTP connectivity layer.

SaloonPHP is a lightweight HTTP client library that provides a simple API for
making HTTP API requests and handling responses. It is designed to be easy to use
and flexible, with a focus on performance and reliability.

SaloonPHP is built on top of the popular [Guzzle](https://docs.guzzlephp.org/)


## Accessing SaloonPHP connector

You can directly access Saloon connector instance via `connector()` method
on the client instance, and call Saloon debugging methods on it - see SaloonPHP
debugging documentation for more details:
https://docs.saloon.dev/the-basics/debugging


## Request and response middleware

Additionally, `connector()` method on the client instance allows you to access
other capabilities of Saloon connector, such as adding middleware via `onRequest()`
or `onResponse()` methods on the Connector instance returned by `connector()`.
See SaloonPHP documentation for more details:
https://docs.saloon.dev/digging-deeper/middleware


## Custom connectors

Instructor allows you to provide custom connector to the client instance via
`withConnector()` method on the API client instance. Provided connector must
inherit from `Cognesy\Instructor\ApiClient\ApiConnector`.


## Customizing HTTP client used by SaloonPHP

SaloonPHP uses Guzzle as its HTTP client by default. You can customize HTTP
sender used by SaloonPHP by providing custom `senderClass` parameter to your connector
constructor, which should be a class name implementing Saloon's `Sender` contract:
