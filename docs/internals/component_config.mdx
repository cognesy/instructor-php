## Component Container

Instructor uses `Configuration` and `ComponentConfig` classes to handle
configuration of all components of the library.


## `Configuration` class

Instructor uses `Configuration` class to handle configuration of all
components of the library. It is used to define components, the way to
instantiate them and the dependencies between components.

`Configuration` class is responsible for instantiation of the components
(and inject them with the configuration data).



## `ComponentConfig` class

`ComponentConfig` class contains a configuration data of a single component.



## Configurators

Instructor uses a set of `Configurators` to define the configuration of the
submodules of the library.

Configurators are classes defining how to wire up a group of components with their
dependencies and setting initial values of parameters.
