## Component Container

Instructor uses `Container` and `ComponentConfig` classes to handle
wiring of the key components of the library.


## `Container` class

Instructor uses `Container` class to handle configuration of all
components of the library. It is used to define components, the way to
instantiate them and the dependencies between components.

`Container` class is responsible for instantiation of the components
(and inject them with the configuration data).



## `ComponentConfig` class

`ComponentConfig` class contains a configuration data of a single component.



## Configurators

Instructor uses a set of 'configurators' to define the wiring of the
submodules of the library.

Configurators are classes defining how to connect up a group of components
with their dependencies and setting initial values of parameters.
