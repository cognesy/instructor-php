# Release Notes v1.15.0

## New Package: agent-ctrl

**Agent Control Package** (`packages/agent-ctrl/`)

Extracted standalone package for agent control and orchestration, previously part of `packages/auxiliary`.

### Key Features

- Agent request/response handling with unified interface
- Event-driven architecture for logging and monitoring
- Independent versioning and distribution
- Sandbox driver support (Docker, Podman, Firejail, Bubblewrap)

## Breaking Changes

If you were using agent control features from the `auxiliary` package, update your imports to use the new `agent-ctrl` package:

```php
// Before
use Cognesy\Auxiliary\Agents\...;

// After
use Cognesy\AgentCtrl\...;
```
