 - (instructor) Breaking changes: the `Instructor` class is being replaced with `StructuredOutput` class; the old class will be kept for some time to allow for a smooth transition.
 - (examples) All examples have been updated to use the new `StructuredOutput` class and recommended create(), generate() methods
 - (docs) Updated documentation to reflect the new `StructuredOutput` class and its usage
 - (instructor) Extracted structured output config into a separate file config/structured.php (and removed from config/llm.php)
 - (instructor) Added structured output config object
 - (instructor) Cleaned up ChatTemplate class
 - (instructor) Response and response streams are now cached after the first call, so multiple calls to `StructuredOutputResponse::response()` or `StructuredOutputResponse::stream()` do not cause re-processing (deserialization, validation, transformation) of the response value
 - (instructor) StructuredOutput class offers fluent API for creating structured output requests
 - (instructor) StructuredOutputResponse now offers getXxx() methods for getting the response value as a specific type (e.g. getString(), getInt(), getFloat(), getBool(), getArray(), getObject())
 - (examples) Added StructuredOutput fluent API example
