## What is Instructor?

Instructor is a library that allows you to extract structured, validated data from multiple types of inputs:

 - text,
 - images,
 - or OpenAI style chat sequence arrays.

Instructor is powered by Large Language Models (LLMs).

The library is inspired by the [Instructor](https://jxnl.github.io/instructor/) for Python created by [Jason Liu](https://twitter.com/jxnlco).


## How it works

Instructor uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to process data and return structured information you can easily use in your code.
