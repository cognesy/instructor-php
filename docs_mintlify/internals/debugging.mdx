Instructor offers several ways to debug it's internal state and execution flow.

## Events

Instructor emits events at various points in its lifecycle, which you can listen to
and react to. You can use these events to debug execution flow and to inspect
data at various stages of processing.

For more details see the [Events](events.mdx) section.


## HTTP Debugging

Instructor gives you access to SaloonPHP debugging mode by calling `withDebug()`
method on Instructor instance. For example:

```php
$result = (new Instructor)->withDebug()->respond(
    messages: "Jason is 25 years old",
    responseModel: User:class,
);
```

Setting debug mode causes underlying SaloonPHP library to output HTTP request and
response details to the console, so you can see what is being sent to LLM API and
what is being received.


## Debugging SaloonPHP requests

You can also directly access Saloon connector instance via `connector()` method
on the client instance, and call Saloon debugging methods on it - see SaloonPHP
debugging documentation for more details:
https://docs.saloon.dev/the-basics/debugging

Additionally, `connector()` method on the client instance allows you to access
other capabilities of Saloon connector, such as setting or modifying middleware.
