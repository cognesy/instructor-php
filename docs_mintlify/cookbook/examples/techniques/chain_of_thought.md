# Chain of Thought

This approach to "chain of thought" improves data quality, by eliciting LLM reasoning to
self-explain approach to generating the response.

> With Instructor you can achieve a 'modular' CoT, where multiple explanations
> can be generated by LLM for different parts of the response, driving a more
> granular control and improvement of the response.
