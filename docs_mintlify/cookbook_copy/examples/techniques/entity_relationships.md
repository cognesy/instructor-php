# Entity relationship extraction

In cases where relationships exist between entities, it's vital to define them
explicitly in the model.

Following example demonstrates how to define relationships between users by
incorporating an `$id` and `$coworkers` fields.

```php
<?php
$loader = require 'vendor/autoload.php';
$loader->add('Cognesy\\Instructor\\', __DIR__.'../../src/');

use Cognesy\Instructor\Enums\Mode;
use Cognesy\Instructor\Instructor;

class UserDetail
{
    /** Unique identifier for each user. */
    public int $id;
    public int $age;
    public string $name;
    public string $role;
    /**
     * @var int[] Correct and complete list of coworker IDs, representing
     * collaboration between users.
     */
    public array $coworkers;
}

class UserRelationships
{
    /**
     * @var UserDetail[] Collection of users, correctly capturing the
     * relationships among them.
     */
    public array $users;
}

$text = <<<TEXT
    Jason is 25 years old. He is a Python programmer of Apex website.
    Amanda is a contractor working with Jason on Apex website. John is
    40yo and he's CEO - Jason reports to him.
    TEXT;

$relationships = (new Instructor)->respond(
    messages: [['role' => 'user', 'content' => $text]],
    responseModel: UserRelationships::class,
);

dump($relationships);

assert(!empty($relationships->users));
?>
```
